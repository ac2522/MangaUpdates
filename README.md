# MangaUpdates
Instead of scrolling through manga and anime websites to find if any new chapters or episodes have come out MangaUptaes will automatically check for you.

Cant be uploaded to chrome extensions as it is using a deprecated manifest version.

Since each website has different strings and regex patterns for chapters, you may need to edit regex patterns for your website patterns.

## To Install

1. Go to "chrome://extensions/"
2. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder


## To Use

- "Update Current Chapter" to update which chapter you are on OR to add/remove a manga from list.
- "Check for New Chapters" will search through all your mangas and check if any have new chapters released.
- "print" displays all urls added - you can copy and paste into the text box to remove bad links or finished manga
